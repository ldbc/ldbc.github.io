 abstract = {This paper provides precise mathematical definitions of a property graph as specified in the proposed GQL international standard, which is an attributed mixed multigraph with loops. It further defines a partially-oriented walk in such a property graph, which is called a path in GQL, as well as restricted classes of such walks (trails, simple/acyclic paths).},
